Welcome to your complete DevOps-ready game project! This guide will help you get up and running quickly.

## 🎯 What You Have

✅ **A Beautiful Space Game** - HTML5 Canvas game with stunning visuals  
✅ **Complete Docker Setup** - Multi-stage Dockerfile with security best practices  
✅ **Kubernetes Manifests** - Production-ready K8s deployment files  
✅ **CI/CD Pipeline** - Jenkins and GitHub Actions workflows  
✅ **Infrastructure as Code** - Terraform for AWS deployment  
✅ **Monitoring Stack** - Prometheus and Grafana configuration

## 🏃‍♂️ Quick Start (Choose Your Path)

### Option 1: Simple Local Testing
```bash
# Open the game directly in your browser
open index.html
# or
python3 -m http.server 8080
# Then visit http://localhost:8080
```

### Option 2: Docker (Recommended)
```bash
# Build and run with Docker
make docker-build
make docker-run

# Or use Docker Compose for full stack
make up

# Access the game at http://localhost:8080
```

### Option 3: Kubernetes
```bash
# Deploy to Kubernetes
make k8s-deploy

# Port forward to access locally
make k8s-port-forward

# Access the game at http://localhost:8080
```

## 🛠️ Development Workflow

1. **Make Changes** to game files (index.html, styles.css, game.js)
2. **Test Locally** with `make dev` or open index.html
3. **Build Container** with `make docker-build`
4. **Deploy** with `make deploy-dev`

## 📊 DevOps Features to Explore

### 🐳 Containerization
- Multi-stage Docker build
- Security hardening (non-root user, read-only filesystem)
- Health checks and proper logging
- Optimized nginx configuration

### ☸️ Kubernetes
- Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA)
- Rolling updates with zero downtime
- Resource limits and requests
- Ingress with TLS termination
- Network policies for security

### 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline
- **Jenkins**: Complete pipeline with stages for build, test, security scan, deploy
- **GitHub Actions**: Modern workflow with matrix builds
- Automated testing and security scanning
- Multi-environment deployment (dev/staging/prod)

### 🏗️ Infrastructure as Code
- **Terraform**: Complete AWS infrastructure
- ECS Fargate for serverless containers
- Application Load Balancer with auto-scaling
- CloudFront CDN for global distribution
- VPC with public/private subnets

### 📈 Monitoring & Observability
- Prometheus metrics collection
- Grafana dashboards
- Health check endpoints
- Application and infrastructure monitoring

## 🎯 Learning Path

### Beginner (Week 1-2)
1. **Play the Game** - Understand what you're deploying
2. **Explore the Code** - Look at HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
3. **Run with Docker** - Learn containerization basics
4. **Deploy to Kubernetes** - Understand orchestration

### Intermediate (Week 3-4)
1. **Customize the Game** - Add features, change styling
2. **Modify CI/CD Pipeline** - Add new stages or tests
3. **Configure Monitoring** - Set up Prometheus and Grafana
4. **Implement Security** - Add scanning and hardening

### Advanced (Week 5-6)
1. **Deploy to Cloud** - Use Terraform for AWS deployment
2. **Set up Multi-Environment** - Dev, staging, production
3. **Implement GitOps** - ArgoCD or Flux for deployments
4. **Add Advanced Monitoring** - Custom metrics and alerting

## 🔧 Common Commands

```bash
# Development
make dev                 # Start development server
make test               # Run tests
make lint               # Code quality checks

# Docker
make docker-build       # Build container image
make docker-run         # Run container locally
make up                 # Start full stack with Docker Compose

# Kubernetes
make k8s-deploy         # Deploy to Kubernetes
make k8s-status         # Check deployment status
make k8s-logs           # View application logs

# Deployment
make deploy-dev         # Deploy to development
make deploy-staging     # Deploy to staging
make deploy-prod        # Deploy to production

# Infrastructure
make terraform-plan     # Plan infrastructure changes
make terraform-apply    # Apply infrastructure changes

# Monitoring
make monitoring-up      # Start monitoring stack
make health-check       # Check application health
make load-test          # Run performance test
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Game Won't Load
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Ensure all files are in the same directory
- Try a different browser or incognito mode

### Docker Issues
```bash
# Check container logs
make docker-logs

# Get shell access
make docker-shell

# Check health
curl http://localhost:8080/health
```

### Kubernetes Issues
```bash
# Check pod status
kubectl get pods -n space-defender

# View pod logs
make k8s-logs

# Describe pod for events
kubectl describe pod <pod-name> -n space-defender
```
